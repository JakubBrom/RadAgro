RadAgro - a QGIS plug-in for analysis of temporal changes of radioactivity contamination of the agricultural landscape
=======================================================================================================================


Description
-----------

RadAgro is software designated for estimation of a radiation
 contamination progress in agricultural landscape. It involves the
 principal landscape elements and processes which could significantly
 influence the radiation load in landscape. Especially important is the
 field management based on crop rotation; also crop characteristics and
 soil erosion are involved. RadAgro simulates the early phase of
 radiation event and following development of radiation contamination
 of the area of interest at monthly intervals.The output of the software
 is a geodatabase of radiation contamination of individual fields of the
 studied area.
